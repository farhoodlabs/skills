# GitHub App Token Skill

Generate a short-lived GitHub installation access token from a GitHub App's credentials and use it to authenticate the `gh` CLI.

## Prerequisites

The following environment variables MUST be set before invoking this skill:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `GITHUB_APP_ID` | The numeric App ID from the GitHub App settings page |
| `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID` | The numeric Installation ID for the target org/user |
| `GITHUB_APP_PEM_FILE` | Absolute path to the GitHub App's PEM private key file |

If any variable is missing, stop and tell the user which ones are required.

Requires `openssl`, `curl`, `grep`, and `jq` (standard on modern environments).

## Steps

### 1. Generate a JWT

Run the helper script bundled with this skill:

```bash
TOKEN=$(bash /path/to/skills/github-app-token/scripts/generate_jwt.sh)
```

The JWT uses:
- **Algorithm**: RS256
- **Header**: `{"alg": "RS256", "typ": "JWT"}`
- **Payload**:
  - `iat`: current time minus 60 seconds (clock drift buffer)
  - `exp`: current time plus 600 seconds (10 minute max)
  - `iss`: the `GITHUB_APP_ID`

### 2. Exchange the JWT for an installation access token

```bash
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  "https://api.github.com/app/installations/${GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID}/access_tokens")

INSTALL_TOKEN=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | grep -o '"token":"[^"]*"' | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f4)
```

If the response contains an error (e.g., `401 Unauthorized`), check:
1. The PEM key matches the App ID
2. The Installation ID is valid for this App
3. The system clock is accurate (JWT `iat`/`exp` are time-sensitive)

### 3. Authenticate the gh CLI

```bash
echo "${INSTALL_TOKEN}" | gh auth login --with-token
```

Verify it worked:

```bash
gh auth status
```

You should see authentication via `token` for `github.com`.

### 4. Cleanup

The installation access token expires after 1 hour. There is nothing to revoke unless you want to explicitly invalidate it early:

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${INSTALL_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  "https://api.github.com/installation/token"
```

## Security Notes

- Never log or echo the PEM key, JWT, or installation token to stdout in production.
- The JWT is valid for at most 10 minutes. The installation token is valid for 1 hour.
- Store the PEM file with restrictive permissions (`chmod 600`) and never check it into git.
